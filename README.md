# Takemichi 🐢

**Takemichi** is a handcrafted collection of 20+ artistic turtle graphics built using Python’s `turtle` module, combining recursive geometry, symmetry, and algorithmic aesthetics.

## The project is live at:  
🌐 [https://rahules24.github.io/takemichi/](https://rahules24.github.io/takemichi/)

> Where each trinket is hosted interactively on:💻 [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io)

## 📌 About

This project serves as an exploration of generative vector graphics using pure Python and the built-in `turtle` module, designed to push the limits of geometric visuals without using external plotting or rendering libraries.

Inspired by the character *Takemichi Hanagaki*'s resilience and iterative growth, each turtle sketch is the result of carefully crafted loops, recursion, and mathematical beauty — all plotted in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🐢 **20+ unique turtle sketches** — From recursive flowers to spirals, fractals, and tessellations.
- 🌀 **Dynamic animations** — Each sketch draws in real time, showcasing the algorithm visually.
- 📄 **Lightweight and dependency-free** — Built with only native Python modules.
- 🌐 **Web-integrated** — Deployed using GitHub Pages and Trinket.io for browser-based execution.

## 🎯 Motivation

Built as a creative coding challenge and visual expression of programming logic, **Takemichi** is both an artistic outlet and a technical proof-of-concept. It demonstrates:
- Use of loops, recursion, and trigonometry in visual computation
- How Python can be used beyond scripting into generative art
- Lightweight web-hosting using GitHub Pages

This project also aligns with my design philosophy of clarity, intent, and aesthetics in code — reflected across my portfolio.
